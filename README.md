# Martin Aquarium <in development>

A website built for the client, Martin. The single page website filters and lists the fishes belonging to Martin, an image for the fish, along with descriptive details of the fish. As an aside of the list, tips are provided regarding fish care and tank maintenance. 

## How to Use

The website is not live, therefore, pulling the code down from gitHub and serving it locally is required to access the site. 

## Languages Used

The site utilizes html, css, and javascript modules. Within the modules are various filter functions for future filter functionality. Some of these functions are currently commented out and can be accessed by un-commenting them. 

## Project Status
Currently in development and additional functionality will be added in the future.
